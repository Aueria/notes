Consider a buck converter:

Consider the output waveform

Using Fourier analysis: The DC component (Average value) of this signal is $DV_g$

Now to get a stable DC value we add a low-pass filter to remove switching harmonics:

There are three basic DC-DC converters:

$M(D)$ is defined as the ratio between the DC output voltage to the DC input voltage:
$$
M(D) = \frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}
$$
