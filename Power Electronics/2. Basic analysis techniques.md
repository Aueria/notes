# Small ripple Approximation

In practice, the output filter only attenuates the harmonics as opposed to completely removing the noise. Therefore, the actual output voltage consists of a DC component ($DV_g$)+ AC ripple

In a well designed converter, the ripple will be very small compared to the DC component
$$
||{V_{ripple}}|| < V
$$
Therefore, the output voltage can be approximated by the DC component only (ignoring the AC ripple)
$$
v(t) \approx V
$$
Few more points regarding the small ripple approximation:

1. Only applicable to continuous waveforms, specifically inductor current and capacitor voltages
2. Switching waveforms should not be using small ripple approx.
3. Used to simplify solution of the filter element waveforms by using approximating exponential/damped sinusoidal as linear functions.
4. It is valid when: switching period << time constants of filter

>Basically, what it means is that any continuous waveform for a short enough time can be approximated by a straight line


# Buck Converter Analysis

Consider the following diagram, we notice that the buck converter can be broken down into 2 simple RLC circuit:

## Switch in position 1

Inductor voltage (using KVL on the left loop):
$$
v_L = V_g - v(t)
$$
Using the small ripple approximation:
$$
v_L \approx V_g - V
$$
Now we find the slope of inductor current:
$$
\begin{align}
v_L(t) &= L \frac{di_L(t)}{dt} \\
\frac{di_L(t)}{dt} &= \frac{v_L(t)}{L} \\
\frac{di_L(t)}{dt} &\approx \frac{V_g-V}{L}
\end{align}
$$

>Using small ripple approximation, the Inductor current changes with a constant slope

## Switch in position 2

Inductor voltage (using KVL on the left loop):
$$
v_L = - v(t)
$$
Using the small ripple approximation:
$$
v_L \approx - V
$$
Now we find the slope of inductor current:
$$
\begin{align}
v_L(t) &= L \frac{di_L(t)}{dt} \\
\frac{di_L(t)}{dt} &= \frac{v_L(t)}{L} \\
\frac{di_L(t)}{dt} &\approx \frac{-V}{L}
\end{align}
$$

## Plotting the inductor voltage and current

![[Pasted image 20250726184756.png]]

At interval 1, voltage across inductor is $V_g - V$, the current increases with the slope $\frac{V_g-V}{L}$
At interval 2, voltage across inductor is $- V$, the current increases with the slope $\frac{-V}{L}$

## Choosing inductance value

First choose the accepted ripple $\Delta i_L$

Then calculate using the formula derived above.

# Turn on transient

![[Pasted image 20250726190719.png]]

1. Begins at V = 0 and I = 0
2. current rises with slope $Vg-V/L$ (derived above), but since output voltage is 0 when t = 0, slope becomes more steep $V_g/L$ 
3. Current drops with slope $-V/L$, since output voltage now $\approx 0$ the slope is almost flat with no drop
4. The process repeats until the slope of rising and falling duration cancels out (reaches steady state)
5. With each step the voltage of the capacitor is charged by a bit until it reaches the steady state voltage

The converter reaches equilibrium when (the waveform becomes periodic):
$$
i_L (n T_s) = i_L ( (n+1) T_s)
$$
